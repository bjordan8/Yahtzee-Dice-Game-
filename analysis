Analysis

1) How much time did you spend working on this project?
	For this project I spent an estimate of 11 hours. I spent probably about 6
	hours creating methods and testing. I believe most of those 6 hours was more 
	testing then coding. The other five hours was creating the game and testing different
	possible outcomes.
	
2) For this project I mostly used my notes and previous labs to help me code
	the project. I had other people play the game to make sure it was sound 
	and not confusing to someone else other than me.
	
3) What was the most difficult part of this project?
	The most difficult part of this project for me was preventing someone from changing the score.
	At first the user was not able to change their score unless there was a zero. I realized this was a flaw
	and I adjusted to code to include a zero took time, as well as lots trial and error.
	
4) I convinced myself that this program works by trying different inputs and seeing different outcomes. This caused me 
	to continually test the program numerous times.
